# AWS Firewalls

Firewalls in AWS are essential for controlling network traffic and securing your cloud resources. AWS provides two main types of firewalls: Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and Security Groups. These can be stateless or stateful, and are defined by sets of inbound and outbound rules.
