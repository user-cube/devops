# Elastic Load Balancers

Elastic Load Balancers are essential tools for ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime in modern applications. By placing multiple instances of an application behind a load balancer, traffic can be intelligently distributed, allowing clients to interact with a single endpoint without needing to know the underlying infrastructure.

When a request is received, the load balancer forwards it to one of the available application instances, improving reliability and scalability.

AWS offers three types of Elastic Load Balancers:
- Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Each type is optimized for different use cases and networking needs.
